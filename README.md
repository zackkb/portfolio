# portfolio

A new portfolio utilizing React. My old portfolio was made during my time as a student with CareerFoundry, and mainly used HTML/CSS. Though nothing was wrong with it, I decided to make this one a little "flashier" to showcase my skills with React while also still being simple and easy to navigate. This is obviously placeholder text until I add more to this project!
