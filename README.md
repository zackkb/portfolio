# portfolio

I recently created a new portfolio that utilizes React, as my previous portfolio that I built while I was a student with CareerFoundry, was primarily using HTML/CSS. I wanted to enhance my portfolio to showcase my proficiency with React while keeping it simple and easy to navigate. This text is only temporary and will be updated as I continue to work on this project.
